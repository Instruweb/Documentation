# Semester 3 - Individual project
### Instruweb sprint planning
___

#### Sprint 1
in this sprint I mainly want to complete some documentation, make sure I pretty much work out the idea into software architecture and further try some Front-end frameworks.  

#### Sprint 2
In this sprint, I want to see if I can already make a connection between the database and the backend. in addition, add some documentation where needed.  

#### Sprint 3
In sprint 3 I want to see if I can make a connection between the API and the backend. if that goes soon I will see if I can make the front-end communicate with the API as well.  

#### Sprint 4
In this sprint I want to have all the functionalities in there so I can start testing if everything works as it should.  

#### Sprint 5
In this sprint I will continue with testing and finalize the product until I have to deliver the project
